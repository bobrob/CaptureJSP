The tutorial for this package can be found at http://technologicaloddity.com/2011/10/04/render-and-capture-the-output-of-a-jsp-as-a-string/

This tutorial shows how to render a JSP, capture the output as a String, all without
having a real request.  It uses Spring 3.  JSPs can handle includes, localization,
taglibs, and almost anything that a normal JSP can handle.
